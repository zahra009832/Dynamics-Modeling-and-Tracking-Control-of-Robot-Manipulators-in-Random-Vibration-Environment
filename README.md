# Dynamics-Modeling-and-Tracking-Control-of-Robot-Manipulators-in-Random-Vibration-Environment
This code simulates a 3-DOF planar robot with 3 actuators and a tracking controller in the presence of stochastic (Brownian) disturbances.

To read about the dynamics of the systam and the controller, first read the reference.pdf file.
